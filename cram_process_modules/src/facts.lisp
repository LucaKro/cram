;;; This file contains a (empty) definitions of Prolog predicates to
;;; reason about which process modules should and can be used to
;;; execute a specific action designator
;;;
;;; The predicate MATCHING-PROCESS-MODULE allows for inferring which
;;; process modules are suitable for executing an action designator,
;;; i.e. it should bind the name of the process module that can
;;; execute ?action-designator.
;;;
;;; The predicate AVAILABLE-PROCESS-MODULE holds for all process
;;; modules that are currently available. When projecting, it should
;;; only hold for the projection process modules of the current
;;; projection environment.
